**Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive study of macroeconomic aggregates, which are crucial indicators reflecting the overall performance and health of an economy. The study focuses on key aggregates such as:

Gross Value Added (GVA)

Net Tax on Products

Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

Gross National Income (GNI)

Net Domestic Product (NDP)

Net National Income (NNI)

Per Capita Income and more.

By analyzing recent data and comparing trends with other nations, the project aims to highlight the role of these aggregates in shaping economic policy, particularly in the context of the Indian economy.

**Objectives**

Understanding Macroeconomic Concepts – Introduction to essential economic aggregates.

Analysis of Economic Performance – Evaluation of trends in key macroeconomic indicators.

Trend Analysis – Examining the growth patterns of various macroeconomic variables over time.

**Methodology**

Data Collection: Secondary data sourced from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the National Statistical Office (NSO).

Analysis Tools: Microsoft Excel is used for trend analysis, data visualization, and representation using tables and graphs.

Comparison: Growth trends in key indicators are compared over the years, highlighting the impact of economic policies and external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Data Analysis & Findings**

Trends in Macroeconomic Aggregates (2013-2018)

The Indian economy exhibited a positive growth trend in key aggregates, peaking in 2017-18.

GVA, GDP, GNI, and NNI steadily increased, reflecting overall economic expansion.

GDP per capita and GNI per capita improved, indicating better economic output per individual.

Net Taxes on Products and Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) showed a steady increase, suggesting rising government revenue and consumer spending.

Trends in Macroeconomic Aggregates (2018-2023)

Impact of COVID-19 (2020-21): The Indian economy faced a contraction, resulting in a decline in key indicators.

Post-pandemic Recovery (2021-2023): The economy rebounded, with GDP, GNI, NDP, and other indicators showing substantial growth.

Highest GDP per capita (2022-23): The economy peaked, indicating improved income levels and economic well-being.

**Key Findings**

Consistent Economic Growth: Indian macroeconomic aggregates have shown resilience and steady expansion over the years.

Pandemic Setback & Recovery: The economic downturn in 2020-21 was temporary, with a strong recovery post-pandemic.

Government Revenue & Consumer Spending: A rise in net taxes and PFCE signifies increasing economic activity and improved consumer confidence.
